### Config.yml
**Please follow the comments provided in config.yml, otherwise exception / unexpected behavior may occur**

#### Settings on enabling / disabling a command
```yaml
# Each command requires a boolean to indicate whether the command is enabled
# If a command is disabled, ALL players cannot execute that command
# true = enable
# false = disable
# REQUIRED : boolean
command-enable:
  serverstatus: true
  head: true
  spawn: true
  announcement: true
  stat: true
  backup: true
```
#### AutoMessage Features
The settings are located at `features.auto-message` in `config.yml`
```yaml
  auto-message:
   # Indicate whether thhe auto-message feature will be enabled or not
   # REQUIRED : boolean
    enable: true
	#Indicate the interval of each auto-message (seconds)
	# REQUIRED : int 
    interval: 180 
    
# Color code for messages starts at '&', followed by the chat code indicator
# For more info, check https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php
# Note that we replace all 'ยง' to '&'
# REQUIRED WHEN ENABLE: String
    msgs:
      - "&bTIPS: Use /spawn can back to your spawnpoint"
      - "&bTIPS: Use /stat can see your own statistics"
      - "&bTIPS: Use /serverstatus can check the current status of the server"
```
If we want to add one more message `"EaseManage is a good plugin!"` without changing the message color, we should change the `features.auto-message.msgs` as follows:
```yaml
msgs:
      - "&bTIPS: Use /spawn can back to your spawnpoint"
      - "&bTIPS: Use /stat can see your own statistics"
      - "&bTIPS: Use /serverstatus can check the current status of the server"
	  - "EaseManage is a good plugin!"
```

#### AutoBackup
The settings are located at `features.auto-backup` in `config.yml`
```yaml
auto-backup:
	# Indicate whether the auto-backup function enables or not
	# REQUIRED : int
    enable: true
	# Indicates the interval of each backup in seconds
	# REQUIRED WHEN ENABLE : int
    interval: 7200
    
    # Max number of backups that you want to save in your disk
    # If the maximum number is reached, then EaseNabage will remove the 
    # oldest backup in your disk (Oldest creation date)
    # indicate -1 if you don't want to delete any backup
    # REQUIRED WHEN ENABLE : int
    max-backups: 10
```

#### Display Name
Currently, we only support changing the prefix and the player color name. Those settings are loacted at `features.display-name` in `config.yml`.
```yaml
  display-name:
   # Indicate whether this function is enabled or not
   # REQUIRED : boolean
    enable: true
    group:
    # List of an object
    # REQUIRED WHEN ENABLE
    # See the following example
      -
        prefix: "&c[EaseManage] "
        colorCode: "&d"
        playerNames: ["Oscar0713"]
```
We need to have the exact key `prefix`, `colorCode`, `playerNames` in each of the element in the list.

Example: If we want to add a player "abcd1234" with his display name changes to green. We should set the `features.display-name.group` as follows:
```yaml
    group:
    # List of an object
    # REQUIRED WHEN ENABLE
    # See the following example
    
      -
        prefix: "&c[EaseManage] "
        colorCode: "&d"
        playerNames: ["Oscar0713"]
      -
        prefix: ""
        colorCode: "&a"
        playerNames: ["abcd1234"]
```
